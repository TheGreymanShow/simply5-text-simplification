# simply5-text-simplification
This paper proposes a tool called ‘Simply5’, which is a Text Simplification system that tries to tackle the problem of understanding complex text and simplify Jargons that make reading difficult. The process of Text Simplification is nothing but the transformation of one piece of text into another, ideally conveying the same meaning, but in a much more simplified manner and which is easy for a layman to understand. Although some research has been done on Text summarization in the growing field of Natural Language Processing, there is no such universal system available for the user wherein he can simplify the text he cannot understand. Through Simply5, we wish to provide the user a handy tool that can be used to simplify any chunk of text, anytime, anywhere on the go.
